<p class="text-center lead">
    This is a page that requires authentication and (possibly) a role or set of roles for authorization.
</p>
<h3>Remember:</h3>
<p>
    <b>Authentication</b> is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a datum or entity. This might involve 
    confirming the identity of a person or software program, tracing the origins of an artifact, or ensuring that 
    a product is what its packaging and labeling claims to be. Authentication often involves verifying the validity 
    of at least one form of identification.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Authorization</b> is the function of specifying access rights to resources, which is related to information 
    security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is 
    to define access policy.
